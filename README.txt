PlatformIO ESP-IDF Quickdevelopment Template
============================================

This is a template project for ESP32 development using PlatformIO and ESP-IDF.

============================================

ESP32S3 USB/JTAG driver needs to be added by the Zadig. Click the `Option` and tick the `List All Devices` to show the ESP32S3 device. In my case, ESP32S3 is the `USB JTAG/serial debug unit (Interface 2)`. Then select the `WinUSB` driver, click the drop-down list and choose `Install Driver` (NOT Install WCID Driver) to install the driver.
